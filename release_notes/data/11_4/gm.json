If timeouts are enabled, either via a test-plan option or via an xcodebuild command-line option, a test will be given a default allowance within which it must complete. Tests that exceed this length of time will fail, and a spindump of the test process will be attached to the test in the test report. If the test needs additional time to run, it can request that time via the executionTimeAllowance property on XCTestCase. For more information, refer to the documentation in XCTestCase.h. (12584283)"
